  \begin{itemize}
    \item Many optimization problems involve constraints that can be naturally modeled as manifolds.
    \item Gradient descent on manifolds extends traditional gradient descent methods to handle these constraints effectively.
    \item Presentation goals: build up the concept of gradient on manifolds and obtain basic convergence results.
    \item Main reference: An Introduction to Optimization on Smooth Manifolds by Nicolas Boumal.
  \end{itemize}
